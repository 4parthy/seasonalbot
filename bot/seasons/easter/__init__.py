    """
    Often celebrated after the first full moon of the Northern Hemisphere's new spring season,
    Easter is a beautiful time of the year with colorful flowers coming out to greet us.

    To celebrate, we have a lovely new colourful server icon. Thanks to <@140605665772175361> for
    the design.

    We hope you can join us in the spring and Easter celebrations by heading over to the
    [SeasonalBot GitHub repo](https://git.io/fjkvQ) and either submit some issues with ideas for
    commands for this season, or to pick out an issue that you think looks fun to work on yourself.

    Come over to <#542272993192050698> if you're interested or have any questions!
