    Manages the guild's branding.

    The purpose of this cog is to help automate the synchronization of the branding
    repository with the guild. It is capable of discovering assets in the repository
    via Github's API, resolving download urls for them, and delegating
    to the `bot` instance to upload them to the guild.

    The cog is designed to be entirely autonomous. The `daemon` background task awakens once
    a day (see `time_until_midnight`) to detect new seasons, or to cycle icons within a single
    season. If the `Branding.autostart` constant is True, the `daemon` will launch on start-up,
    otherwise it can be controlled via the `daemon` cmd group.

    All supported operations, e.g. setting seasons, applying the branding, or cycling icons, can
    also be invoked manually, via the following API:

        branding set <season_name>
            - Set the cog's internal state to represent `season_name`, if it exists.
            - If no `season_name` is given, set chronologically current season.
            - This will not automatically apply the season's branding to the guild,
              the cog's state can be detached from the guild.
            - Seasons can therefore be 'previewed' using this command.

        branding info
            - View detailed information about resolved assets for current season.

        branding refresh
            - Refresh internal state, i.e. synchronize with branding repository.

        branding apply
            - Apply the current internal state to the guild, i.e. upload the assets.

        branding cycle
            - If there are multiple available icons for current season, randomly pick
              and apply the next one.

    The daemon calls these methods autonomously as appropriate. The use of this cog
    is locked to moderation roles. As it performs media asset uploads, it is prone to
    rate-limits - the `apply` command should be used with caution. The `set` command can,
    however, be used freely to 'preview' seasonal branding and check whether paths have been
    resolved as appropriate.

    While the bot is in debug mode, it will 'mock' asset uploads by logging the passed
    download urls and pretending that the upload was successful. Make use of this
    to test this cog's behaviour.
